# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm install
node app.js
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```
if you want change the url of Swagger IU you must do this:

1.Go to node_modules\swagger-tools\middleware\swagger-ui.js
find this:

```
var defaultOptions = {
  apiDocs: '/api-docs',
  swaggerUi: '/docs'
};

```
and check how you want
example: 
- if you want have doc on "/app/docs"

apiDocs: is only JSON File
swaggerUi: is documentation interface (interactive doc.)
```
var defaultOptions = {
  apiDocs: '/api-docs',
  swaggerUi: '/api/docs'
};

```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
